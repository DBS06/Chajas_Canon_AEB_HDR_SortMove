# Chaja's - CANON HDR SortMove

Is a script which helps to sort HDR images.
This repository includes two scripts:

* **HDR_Move_ML.py:** Is for images which are taken with Magic-Lanterns “Advanced Bracket” mode. **Note:** The option to create a txt-file inside the “Post scripts” setting must be enabled. The created *.txt* file contains the HDR-Sequence.
* **HDR_Move_EXIF.py:** Magic-Lantern isn’t available for Canon 60D+ Models, therefore I wrote a second script which reads and analyze the EXIF-Data and detects the HDR sequences. It’s only tested on Canon 80D and 60D, because I have no other Canon Models.
