# Chaja's - Canon AEB HDR SortMove

Is a python script which helps to sort HDR images.

Originally this Script was written to work with Magic-Lantern, but Magic-Lantern isn’t available for Canon 60D+ Models, therefore I wrote a second script which reads and analyzes the EXIF-Data and detects the HDR sequences.
This repository includes two scripts:

* **HDR_Move_EXIF.py:** This is the general purpose script for Canon EOS Cameras to sort HDR-Sequences which were shot with *Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB)*.
* **HDR_Move_ML.py:** Is for images which are taken with Magic-Lanterns “Advanced Bracket” mode. **Note:** The option to create a txt-file inside the “Post scripts” setting must be enabled. The created *.txt* file contains the HDR-Sequence.

## Supported and tested Models

**HDR_Move_EXIF.py** tested with Canon EOS 60D and 80D. Will be constantly supported and updated if necessary.
**HDR_Move_EXIF.py** tested with Canon EOS 60D and Magic-Lantern-Nightly.2018Jul03.60D111. Will not be constantly supported and updated, because I am not using Magic-Lantern anymore (not available for my 80D).
